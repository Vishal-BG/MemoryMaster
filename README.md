Memory Master: Advanced Memory Management for Android Devices
Memory Master is an innovative Android application designed to intelligently optimize memory management, providing users with enhanced performance, improved multitasking, and extended battery life. As mobile applications grow increasingly resource-intensive, efficient memory management is critical for maintaining a smooth user experience. Memory Master leverages advanced memory management techniques and Kotlin coroutines to provide real-time, adaptive optimizations without compromising usability.

Features
Adaptive Memory Allocation: Learns and adapts to user behavior over a 7-day period to predict and optimize memory allocation dynamically.
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks memory usage and optimizes it automatically, reducing manual intervention.
Intelligent Prediction: Uses historical data and the UsageStatsManager API to predict future memory requirements.
Background Operation: Efficient memory management with Kotlin coroutines, ensuring minimal impact on user experience.
User-friendly Interface: Presents clear and actionable insights into device memory usage.
Battery Life Extension: Optimizes memory and resource consumption to extend battery longevity.
Enhanced Multitasking: Improves the device's ability to handle multiple applications concurrently.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To get started with Memory Master, you’ll need:

Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1 or later
Kotlin 1.5.0 or later
Minimum SDK: Android 5.0 (API level 21)
Target SDK: Android 11 (API level 30)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Vishal-BG/MemoryMaster.git
Open the project in Android Studio.

Sync the project with Gradle files.

Build and run the application on your Android device or emulator.

Usage
Launch the Memory Master application.
Grant the necessary permissions when prompted.
Allow the app to run in the background for at least 7 days to learn user behavior for optimal performance.
Continue to use your device as usual while Memory Master optimizes memory in real time.
Access the app to view detailed memory usage statistics and optimization results.

Key Functions
learnUserBehavior(): Analyzes app usage patterns over a 7-day period to optimize memory management.
predictMemoryNeeds(): Utilizes historical usage data to predict future memory needs and adjust allocations.
optimizeMemoryAllocation(): Dynamically allocates memory based on both predictions and current usage.
monitorPerformance(): Monitors and reports on the device’s performance metrics.
Customization
Developers can modify key parameters such as the learning period, optimization algorithms, or the UI by adjusting the corresponding values in MemoryManager.kt and activity_main.xml. This flexibility allows for deeper integration or adjustments based on specific use cases.
